# Loyalty-Scheme
For your Week 4 project, you’re going to develop a business case and get it signed off. You’ll present to a panel of “experts” who represent the Prism investment committee. There will be some intense Q&A, followed by a decision to approve or reject the recommendation.
Preparation
Consider the following information:

Prism already have a pilot loyalty scheme rolled out to 10,000 customers
You should aim to analyse the behaviour of these customers over the last 6 months, then extrapolate this out to the rest of the business. 
You’ll need to come up with ideas for what the offers might be for increased loyalty, then model what this would look like from a revenue perspective
Calculate RFM
Look at shipping and return costs
Look at discounting
Look at offering Prism+ customers early access to sales, early product launches, and a ‘1-click purchase’ option
Which of these would you do?
What would be the impact on the data?
Which segment would you target?
How would you develop the business case doc?
Wireframe your approach before you build anything!
.

Analysis
The concept of Prism+ could in theory incorporate all of the analyses already completed across all functional areas to answer:
who is the audience? (customer segmentation and classification)
how engaged are they? (email, social, other marketing)
what characterises the behaviour of this group and what factors trigger the purchase? (web user journeys and conversion, product propensity and pairings)
how profitable is this group? (product margin, returns, shipping and pricing)

The next piece is to consider:
how to grow this group? how to move customers into this group?
what perks could we offer them?
what is the upside? need to think tangible (cash) vs intangible (brand) and compare to costs
